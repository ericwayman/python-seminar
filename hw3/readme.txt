draw_rectangle.py defines a draw_rectangle class.  The class displays a 4x4 grid of plots from the data in flowers.txt found in hw_3_data.  The class allows you to click on any subplot and trace a rectangle object in that class.  I wasn't able to finish the brushing functionality in time.

hw_3_1.py is the list of commands to reproduce the plot in HW31_example.  the plot is saved in hw_3_1_plot.png


stocks_plot.py is the list of commands to reproduce the plot in hw_3_data.  The plot is saved as hw_3_2_plot.png
