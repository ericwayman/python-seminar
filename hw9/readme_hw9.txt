Included in this homework is the file “parellelization.ipynb”.
Before running the file, you should start up 4 engines in the I python dashboard menu.  Or if you prefer you can uncomment out a line in the code to start up the machines automatically, but i found this to be buggy.

The code approximates pi using a simple Monte Carlo method.  The performance time and simulation rate is computed using simple serialization, Ipython clusters and multiprocessing.  The results are plotted.
