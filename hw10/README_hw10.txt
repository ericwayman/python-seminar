Included in this homework are the files

bibtex_database.py
and a folder called templates which contains the files:
main_page.html
base.html
query.html

Running bibtex_database.py launches a web app on the local host.  
It allows a user to upload a .bib file which is saved in a SQL database.
The user can then query the database using a valid SQL query by typing a string following the “WHERE” command of a SQL query.  It functions like the example in the homework.  

I wasn’t able to successfully display the results of the query in the page, so they are just printed in the terminal.
